# Run the website locally

1. **Install dependencies** (once):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in your browser**  
   Vite will print a URL, usually:
   - **http://localhost:5173**

   Click it or paste it into your browser to view the site.

---

If `vite` is not recognized, run from the project folder in a terminal where you’ve already run `npm install` (e.g. PowerShell or Command Prompt in `c:\Users\Aanis\Desktop\WEBSITE\Anis`).
